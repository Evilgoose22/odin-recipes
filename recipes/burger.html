    <p>I like burgers. Burgers make me happy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Burger Buns</li>
      <li>Beef Mince</li>
      <li>Iceberg Lettuce</li>
      <li>Bacon</li>
      <li>Jalapenos</li>
      <li>Red Onions</li>
      <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
      <li>Sliced Cheese</li>
      <li>Gherkins</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice, and prepare all of your burger toppings and sauces.</li>
      <li>
        Spread the cut-side of the bun with softened or melted butter and toast
        the cut side on a skillet or on the grill until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat grill to medium heat. Divide ground beef into 4 portions and
        form patties that are about 1/2" thick. Season patties generously with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill hamburger patties for approximatley 3-5 minutes each side on the
        grill. Flip burgers when juices are accumulating on top of the burger
        and you have a good sear. Apply cheese in the last 1-2 minutes of
        grilling then cover with the lid and cook until melted.
